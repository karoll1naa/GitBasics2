The text can be divided into paragraphs, leaving 1 (one) blank line between paragraphs.</p><p>We can highlight text <b>bold</b>, make it <i>italic</i> or fixed width''. It is also possible to save <tt>fragments</tt> of reformatted text:</p><p>This text is reformatted.<pre>This means that it **will**be displayed as isand no other formatting such as **bold** or _italics_ will be applied to it</pre></p>
